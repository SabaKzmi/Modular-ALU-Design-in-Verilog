# Modular ALU Design in Verilog
This Verilog project features an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with capabilities for addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement. It also performs logical operations such as
AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. The design is modular, enhancing clarity and reusability.
## How to Use
1. Prepare: Save the Verilog files.
2. Project Setup: Create a project in ModelSim and add the files.
3. Compile: Compile all files.
4. Simulate: Run the tbALU.v test bench module to simulate the ALU's functionality and observe the results.
## Results
Here are the results from the uploaded test bench.
